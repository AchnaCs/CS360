# App Requirements and Goals
The app was developed to address the need for a weight-tracking application. It allows users to monitor and log their daily weight, set weight goals, and track their progress. The primary user need it aims to address is helping individuals manage their weight and achieve their weight-related goals.

# User-Centered Design
To support user needs, the app included screens for weight logging and goal setting. The UI designs were user-centered as they focused on simplicity and user-friendliness. Users could easily input their weight data and visualize their progress, which kept them motivated. 

# Coding Process
The coding process followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, separating concerns for maintainability. It also incorporated the SQLite database to store user weight data persistently. In future projects, this separation of concerns and the use of a local database can be applied to creating structured and maintainable apps.

# Testing and Importance
Extensive testing was conducted, including testing code often with the Android Emulator. This testing process was crucial as it revealed occasional issues with data synchronization and input validation. 

# Innovation and Challenges
An innovative aspect of the project was integrating SMS notification functionality for sending alerts to users based on their weight goals. Challenges were faced in handling user permission responses. To overcome this, we implemented a permission handling system that allowed the app to continue functioning seamlessly, even if the user denied SMS permissions.

# Successful Knowledge Demonstration
A particular component where success was demonstrated was the SQLite database integration. It allowed users to store and retrieve weight data efficiently. This showcased our knowledge of data management and persistence, ensuring that user data was retained and easily accessible.
